A few words before we begin. If you want to know the specific of each function, please refer to the relevant vignette. Also, if you don't know about `dplyr::select` syntax, I highly recommend learning it. It is very simple and intuitive, and you can take the most advantage out of of this package.

## Regression Models 
### `model_summary_with_plot` 
`model_summary_with_plot` is the integrated function for linear mixed effect models. If an interaction term is added, it will plot a two-way or three-way interaction plot. 


```{r,eval=FALSE}
# select syntax is supported for all variables. I didn't showcase it here, but you can use 
# more versatile function like contains() or everything()
 fit <- model_summary_with_plot(
   data = popular,
   response_variable = popular,
   random_effect_factors = c(extrav, sex),
   non_random_effect_factors = texp,
   three_way_interaction_factor = extrav:sex, # here, I used the : to select variable between extrav and sex
   id = class
 )
```
The model summary is shown below. This summary can also be generated by using the `model_summary` function.

![mode-summary-plot](../man/figures/mode_summary_plot.png){width=100%} 

If you included an interaction term, it will produce the interaction plot. Additionally, if you wish, you can set `plot_color = T` to plot colored plot. 

![interaction-plot](../man/figures/interaction_plot.png){width=100%} 


Additionally, if you are interested in visually inspecting the assumption plot (recommended), then you can set `assumption_plot = T`. An example is shown below. 

![assumption-plot](../man/figures/assumption_plot.png){width=100%} 


Finally, if you want the simple slope ï¼ˆi.e., the slope estimate at high, mean, low of the interaction variable), then you can set `simple_slope = T`. The function will produce a graph and the text output. The example of the output is shown below.
