# Fitting Model with `dplyr::select` syntax 
I will discuss the most commonly-used / relevant `dplyr::select` syntax in here. However, you should definitely check out `dplyr` package (or the entire `tidyverse` package).

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

```{r setup}
library(psycModel)
```
